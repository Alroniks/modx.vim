## Help Me

I am new to MODX and to VimScript so any help is much appreciated - issues and pull requests are gratefully received.

There will be missing keywords and subtleties in the syntax which I am not aware of yet, these will be added as I begin working with MODX more. 

I am especially interested in more experienced MODX folk testing out the highlighting with larger 'real world' templates.
